# Data-Analysis-of-Road-Accidents
Data Analytics Project 2019
Team name: SSA
SRNs: PES1201700048, PES1201701348 ,PES1201701540
The project is data analysis on a road accidents dataset which aims at predicting the severity of accidents by taking into account various factors that are significant. The dataset chosen has information about accidents that occurred in UK between 2010 and 2014. Different machine learning models will be implemented that will classify the severity of the accidents based on the deciding attributes. This project is an attempt to find the relationship between several attributes and the dichotomous target variable. Also, several patterns and trends leading to accidents will be unearthed which will provide important information that can be used to avoid accidents. Several performance metrics will be used to determine the best model. Several insights will be made like determining the likelihood of accidents occurring for different groups of vehicles, the driver's age, etc will be carried out.
